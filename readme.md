### Project Overview

Sushiify demonstrates a modular approach to building, training, and deploying image classification models using PyTorch and torchvisionâ€™s EfficientNet variants. The codebase is organized to separate data handling, model definition, training engine, and prediction/visualization logic.

Key features:
- **Pretrained EfficientNet** (B0 & B2) with transfer learning  
- **Modular data loaders** for train/test splits with torchvision transforms  
- **Reusable training engine** with logging via TensorBoard  
- **Utility functions** for reproducibility and loss-curve plotting  
- **Inference scripts** for batch and custom-image prediction with visualization
